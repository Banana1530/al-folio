Hi! My name is Luofeng Liao (廖烙锋 in Chinese) and I am a first-year phd student in the IEOR Department at Columbia.

My research interests are deep/machine learning methods for causal inference and econometrics, reinforcement learning with observational data, nonparametric statistics and minimax optimization.

Prior to Columbia, I received my bachelor’s degree in computer science in Fudan University in China and a master's degree in statistics in University of Chicago. In UChicago, I used to work with Prof. [Mladen Kolar](https://mkolar.coffeejunkies.org) and Prof. [Zhaoran Wang](https://zhaoranwang.github.io).
