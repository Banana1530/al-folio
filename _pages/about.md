Hi! My name is Luofeng Liao (廖烙锋 in Chinese) and I am a first-year phd student in the IEOR Department at Columbia.

My research interests are deep/machine learning methods for causal inference and econometrics, reinforcement learning with observational data, nonparametric statistics and minimax optimization.

Prior to Columbia, I received my bachelor’s degree in computer science in Fudan University in China and a master's degree in statistics in University of Chicago. In UChicago, I used to work with Prof. [Mladen Kolar](https://mkolar.coffeejunkies.org) and Prof. [Zhaoran Wang](https://zhaoranwang.github.io).



Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
